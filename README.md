GAMEBOX - A PHP & Angular full stack application.

GAMEBOX is an application designed to simplify the used game market buying experience. Even though most new games are digital today, there will always be a demand for used games that are either rare, limited edition, or simply cheaper. GAMEBOX is supposed to streamline that process by allowing users to create an account, post games they want to sell, search games they are interested buying, and adding the games to their shopping cart. 

GAMEBOX was originally intended to be developed using PHP purely, but I then added Angular for the front end for the convenience in it's modularity and for the desire to implement the application using a more modern approach. This hybrid development allowed for me to additionally learn how to create APIs for communication between the two languages and 2 way data binding for updating data on both front/back end. 

Inside the project you will see the "app" directory which contains the Angular backend, and the "gamebox" directory which contains the PHP front end along with database connections.
